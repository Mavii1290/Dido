These large, vibrant green olives are hand-harvested before full ripeness to preserve their natural color. For five generations, our family has cultivated 100% sustainably grown Castelvetrano olives. Each olive is hand-picked to maintain its color, flavor, and texture, avoiding bruising and oxidation. Post-harvest, we cure and preserve them using natural sea salt from Trapani, Sicily. Versatile and delicious, Castelvetrano Olives are ideal as a snack, a vibrant addition to charcuterie boards, or a flavorful twist in a Martini.",
